								<h2>Who am I?</h2>
								<p>My name is Ross Benson aged 21. I am currently a third year Business Management student from the University of Sheffield. I have proficiencies in Excel, PowerBI, Qlik, Statistical analysis, report writing and Coding (HTML/CSS3, Python). </p>
								<h2>My education</h2>
								<p>In 2019, I completed 9 GCSEs, which sparked my interest in Business Studies, prompting me to choose it as an optional subject. I then enrolled at Lincoln College to pursue an AAT Foundation Certificate in Accounting, earning a Merit grade. After some reflection, I decided to switch to Business Studies at Lincoln College. Over the next two years, I achieved outstanding results: a Distinction*, Distinction, and Distinction, equivalent to A*, A, and A. In my final year, I was also honoured with the titles of Business and Education Student of the Year.</p>
								<p>These achievements enabled my to enrol for a place at the University of Sheffield to study Business Management. The first year consisted of the following modules: Analysis in decision making, Management themes and perspectives, Business Management in context, Accounting and Finance, Introduction to behaviour at work, Business economics.</p>
								<p>In my second year, I was able to select two optional modules and 4 core modules. They were as follows: Optional, Business Intelligence, Business Statistics. Core, Business strategy, Essentials of marketing, Principles of operations management, Organisational behaviour. My optional modules were chosen based upon my interest in Data and my interest in becoming a business analyst. My first two projects on my page are from my time at university.</p>
								<p>My upcoming third and final year I have chosen the following modules: International marketing, Decision sciences and optimisation, International Business, Strategic organisational crisis management, New venture creation and with a core module being Corporate social responsibility.</p>
								<p>Currently, in my final summer as a student, I signed up for Linkedin learning, this enabled me to learn more about becoming a business analyst. I studied courses around PowerBI, Excel for business analysts and introduction to Business Analytics. As summer continues, I look to learn more on SQL, PowerBI, Excel and more. </p>
								<h2>Motivations to become a Business Analyst</h2>
								<p>In my first year of university, I had the opportunity to attend a talk by Prof. Clive Humby, the mastermind behind the Tesco Clubcard. His talk, which began with his personal journey and achievements, included the memorable quote, "data is the new oil." This inspiring presentation sparked my initial interest in data.

									In my second year, I was fortunate to attend another talk by Prof. Humby. This time, I managed to connect with him on LinkedIn and engage in a meaningful conversation during the event. This interaction was pivotal in crystallizing my desire to become a Business Analyst, as it deepened my understanding of the field and its potential.</p>
								<p>
									During my second year, I encountered a digital creator named Michael Maz, a senior Business Analyst who has been instrumental in helping students and undergraduates pursue their dreams. Engaging with him personally and receiving his advice about becoming a Business Analyst greatly influenced me. His guidance allowed me to develop this portfolio and enhance my skills in areas that are crucial for a Business Analyst's daily responsibilities. This experience further solidified my aspiration to enter the field.</p>
								<h2>Looking into the future</h2>
								<p>As my education and interactions have driven me to become a Business analyst, I prepare to apply for graduate schemes and internships following my completion of my degree in business management.
