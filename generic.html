								<h2>My background and motivations</h2>
								<p>My name is Ross Benson aged 21 from Lincolnshire. My interest in becoming a business analyst dates all the way back to 2019 when I got my first work experience, I spent 3 days in the Leeds Office of Brewin Dolphin, one of the UK's largest Wealth Managers. The experience I gained covered areas in both investment management and financial planning. I was involved in settling investment transactions and doing basic company research to assist senior management. This experience gave me an oppurtunity to understand quantative research and the importance of it. I then went to Lincoln College to study AAT Level 2 Accounting. This oppurtunity gave me the oppurtunity to gain more work experience at Dexter Sharpe Accountants. A further understanding of the precision needed within the finance industry and the imoportance of data allowed me to realise my desire to work in data. </p>
								<p>Continuing my jounrney at college, I then moved to studying an Extended Diploma in Business Studies. During my two years, I achieved a grade equivalent of A*,A,A and was awarded Business and Education Student of the Year. These achievements allowed me to enrol at The University of Sheffiled to study Business Management. Approaching my final year averaging a 2:1, it has enabled me to network and meet people already involved in Data. </p>
								<p>My first involvement was meeting Prof. Clive Humby, a staple in data, creating the quote 'Data is the new oil'. His talk taught me about his journey creating the tesco clubcard. His story and background inspired me to research into a career in data. This curiosity allowed me to meet Michael Maz who is a senior business analyst. His videos on TikTok explaining what he does and his day to day life encouraged me to further research the role and connect with him on a personal level. As of now, these interactions have inspired me to work on my skillset for a role in Business Analytics </p>
								<h2>Looking into the future.</h2>
								<p>Looking forward, this summer I have dedicated my time to learn some of the key elements of a Business Analyst, this includes LinkedIn learning courses on: PowerBI, Excel, Business Analyst Skills, Business Analyst Decision making and many more. In addition, the continuation of my three personal projects will be in action over my summer break. Furhtermore, in the academic year 2024/25 I will be finalising my degree in business management. In this year I look to start new projects, boost my network and look for potential extracurricular work.</p>
								<p>I am excited to start my journey to become a Business Analyst. I am thankful to those who have inspired me to choose this career path as it challenges me each an every day. I will be updating this page as come my achievements, so please return as you please.</p>
